                <p>Blizzard, age 7, is a mixed New Zealand rabbit who was born on January 28, 2015. 
                    I adopted Blizzard when I was 12 years old, so I have many fond memories with her.
                    Blizzard loves all types of fresh vegetables, never leaving any leftovers behind on her plate.
                    She also is willing to do tricks in trade for any kind of rabbit treat. What is shocking to a lot of
                    non-rabbit owners is that Blizzard has been litter-trained since an early age. When Blizzard is happiest,
                    she likes to binky (run around like crazy) and flop (drop to the floor). 
                    Blizzard has been nicknamed Blizzy and Blip by friends and family.

                    Penang, also known as Penny, is a 3-year-old tabby cat who was born on February 18, 2019. 
                    She is a very chatty cat who purrs very loudly and meows in greeting, happiness, hunger, 
                    and even sadness. Penny is a very sweet and cuddly cat, but she can also be quite mischeivious. 
                    Unlike her brother, she has a particular taste for human food and will do anything she wants
                    if there's nobody there to stop her. Penang is the more courageous cat, as she is unbothered by
                    children, the vet, and even her brother. Penang was named after the Malaysian island that my 
                    mother is from.

                    Borneo, or Bo, is a 3-year-old tabby cat who was born on February 18, 2019. 
                    Bo has a special interest in opening doors, calling humans from far away, and trying to flush toilets.
                    He has a strange affinity for water, as he likes to swish his paws around in it. 
                    Additionally, he really likes to go underneath blankets and sit inside of laundry baskets. 
                    He bullies his sister Penny sometimes, but they are often seen grooming each other and sleeping together.
                    Borneo does not like meeting new people, especially if they are children or the vet! But if you are 
                    patient and kind with him, he will begin to open up to you. Borneo was named after the Malaysian island
                    that my father is from.
